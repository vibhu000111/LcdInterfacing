# LcdInterfacing
In this program I used an LCD display in 4bit mode with atmega328p and used 2 pins for external interrupts when the user presses the button the timer countdown is set and
shown on the LCD display and when the user wants to start the timer press another button which will execute another ISR that will start the countdown till zero.
